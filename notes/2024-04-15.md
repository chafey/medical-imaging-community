## Agenda
- Keep everything the Radiologist saw, E.g. AI results - requirement or issue? AI or even CAD results could change a year or two later if re-run.
  - Save presentation state and key images is the norm currently
  - AI results are by default a DICOM series, which is currently persisted by default. Getting rid of it would require an explicit delete.
  - Some institutions don't archive the AI results. The AI vendors do keep them, but not the institution
  - Evidence documents are supposed to be persisted for legal reasons, taking into account lifecycle management rules.
  - IHE working on a profile `Imaging Diagnotic Report` to allow Radiologists to include evidence, such as AI results.
    - Also see https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=175616940
  - What AI that runs after the reporting has been done? E.g. to ensure the Radiologist didn't miss any pathologies?
    - Ultimately it is the responsbility of the Radiologist to ensure things are recorded. This case isn't clear since it is post-processing. It might be up to the FDA or something.
  - Provenance use in AI: https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2024/01/provenance-use-in-ai.html
  - AI will evolve to do a lot of work up-front. E.g. detecting pneumothorax on the scanner while the patient is still in the room being imaged.
