## Agenda

* Medical Imaging Community Meeting Management Change
  * Current system is problematic
  * Switch to using google mailing list instead of zoom invite mechanism
    * Setup new gmail account to catch all meeting responses (so Mohannad doesn't get them) 
    * Mailing list will only be used to coordinate meeting related matters (e.g. cancellations, special topics)
    * Will still use Zoom for meetings, but will require a new zoom link that will change annually
  * Need to pick a cut off date to switch over 
    * Aug 12, 2024
  * Mohannad to create a linked-in post so we can all share/like/comment
