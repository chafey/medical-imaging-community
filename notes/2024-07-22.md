## Agenda

* Crowdstrike Issue
  * Some kind of anti-virus software that runs as a ring 0 kernel device driver
  * Depends on some configuration that it downloads from the internet
  * Pushed out an update that puts an invalid definition file which caused it to crash
  * Marked as a "mandatory driver" so OS would not disable after causing crashes
  * Required "manual intervention" to fix - manually reboot to safe mode, log in, disable/fix, restart?
  * Southwest Airlines not impacted because they run Windows 3.1!
  * Fundamental Issues:
    * One vendor too prominent that can push over the air updates that can't be easily rolled back
  * Explanation video for what happened:
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAzEJxOo1ts

* AWS Deployment
  * Use feature flags
  * Push the software first, then enable features second
  * Staged region deployments

* AWS HealthImaging new DICOMweb APIs 
  * GetInstanceMetadata
  * GetImageFrames
 
* How do you evaluate the quality of AI?
  * HL7 Meeting on AI tracking
    * Video Recording: https://hl7-org.zoom.us/rec/play/N-RFFjnao9iwn4_0iRCkeQbyQW7aboXaQXNcp8zMThA69VuiacTTelNm3i308dkp03E3364O2MQ3kWA4.PPiSs0rXByaMByTt

* Chris' Custom Liquid Cooling Loop 
  * AIO - 
  * Delved into my first custom loop in December
    * Motivation: Mess around with overclocking
  * What i have now is:
    * 2x540mm radiators
    * GPU Waterblock for by 4090
    * CPU Waterblock for my 7950x3d
    * D5 pump
  * What I have learned
    * Not very effective at assisting with CPU overclocking
      * Yes some improvement BUT the CPUs just run hot very quickly faster than the liquid cooler can remove the heat 
    * No matter how much I push the CPU, the water temp in is ambient - so the radiators work well
    * Not sure the CPU waterblcok is all that great
