  - HELIX - model editor like VIM but has great defaults. Written in Rust

  - 10 key/numkey support?

    - no default mappings, created before 10 key was around

  - Can get vim motions for your shell too!

- Updating DICOM via REST (DICOMweb / FHIR)

  - IHE profile for this - IOCM - Let you delete/hide/change uids, but not specific attributes

  - Using URI's to reference DICOMWeb studies problematic as the hostname may need to change (e.g. change vendors, split archibve on prem/cloud )

  - Should look at Orthanc to see what they do
