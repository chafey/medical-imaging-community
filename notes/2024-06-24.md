  * FHIRCast + OHIF Integration (and other viewers - Visage?  SyngoVIA?)
    
* HIPAA and Privacy
  * US Laws seem too heavy weight
  * How many people really care about their records being private?
  * How secure is it really?
  * Should it be changed such that a patient can opt-in to privacy?
  * HIPAA fines prevent sharing of de-identified data sets for AI/Analytics purposes due to risk/fear/penalites
    * Safer to not share than take the risk of sharing to advance AI/healthcare
    * hinders patient care due to access
    * increases costs - e.g. duplicate scans
