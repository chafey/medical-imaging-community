## Agenda

* Floating Point Pixel Sample Data
  * https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/tree/master/data/paramaps 
  * https://dicom4qi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instructions/pm/
  * https://herrmannlab.github.io/slim/studies/1.3.6.1.4.1.5962.99.1.2447135355.1068687300.1625944806011.3.0

*  IHE AI Results
  * Any success mapping to vendors?
  * No vendors support all codes
  * Trying to map from different vendors to a single standard
  * Lots of different coding systems
    * Architecture should support multiple code sets
      * Insurance vs registry
      * Diagnostic vs billing
    * Will alawys have multiple codes and always have different local interpretations of codes
  * Agreement signed collaboration agreement between LOINC(RadLex) and SNOMED to map between the two
    * LOINC doesnt have good support for findings
    * Radiology is very granular in findings - e.g. charactersitcs of nodules/tumors
    * SNOMED-CT has better support for findings
  * IHE does not constrain to specific code schemes
    * Focuses on how to share them


* What people are hearing in different countries about reimbursements for AI?
  * USA - nothing?
  * One vendor looking to sell their data to help offset costs for AI
  * Charge whoever is benefiting from AI
    * healthcare system
    * Rad group/practice
  * Article on business models for AI in medical imaging:
    * https://www.signifyresearch.net/medical-imaging/business-models-ai-medical-imaging/
  * Canada?  Ontario
    * No revision in payments in a decade

* Data Market
  * People are more willing to sell this over the past 5 years
  * De-identifying DICOM data is hard
  * https://dandelionhealth.ai/
    * licenses federated access to de-id’d data from Sharp and Sanford Health.
  * https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/
    * is working on federated access to a bunch of de-id’d data
  * nVidia FLAIR - federated learning
    * https://developer.nvidia.com/flare
